Single Page Application vs Multi-page Application 

SPA
A single-page application is defined as an application (web app or website) that loads only a single page and then rewrites the page with new content fetched from a web server as the user interacts with it instead of loading a new page for every interaction. 

MPA
Several page applications (MPA) contain multiple pages containing static data and links to other sites. HTML and CSS are the primary technologies used to develop MPA websites. They may use JavaScript to reduce load and increase speed.
