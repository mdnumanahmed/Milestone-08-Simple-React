Single Page Application vs Multi-page Application 

SPA
A single-page application is defined as an application (web app or website) that loads only a single page and then rewrites the page with new content fetched from a web server as the user interacts with it instead of loading a new page for every interaction. 

MPA
Several page applications (MPA) contain multiple pages containing static data and links to other sites. HTML and CSS are the primary technologies used to develop MPA websites. They may use JavaScript to reduce load and increase speed.

Attributes are defined by HTML. Properties are accessed from DOM (Document Object Model) nodes.

While writing HTML code, you can define attributes on your HTML elements. Then, once the browser parses your code, a corresponding DOM node will be created. This node is an object, and therefore it has properties.


Attribute: Attributes are defined by HTML and are used to customize a tag.
Properties: HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change.
So, the main differences between attributes and properties are:
Attributes are defined by HTML, but properties are defined by the DOM.
The value of an attribute is constant, but the value of a property is variable.
The attribute’s main role is to initializes the DOM properties. So, once the DOM initialization complete, the attributes job is done.
